<p>As a seasoned translator with 17 years of experience, I work with companies to showcase their products and services, and to help them communicate effectively with their target audience. Although I have a Spanish name, my family relocated to the United States before I turned one, where I was raised in a bicultural setting. English is my mother tongue and I only translate from Spanish into English. Around my 30th birthday, I decided to leave Washington DC, my hometown, and move back to Europe. I settled down in Alicante because of the fantastic climate and slower-paced life, but I continue to travel regularly throughout Europe and the rest of the world.</p> 
<p>Because I have a bilingual understanding of both Spanish and English, my translations are based on the intended message and not just the actual words. This is particularly important when building a brand and targeting specific segments. Having worked a number of years at SMEs and multinationals in the United States and Spain, I have experienced firsthand many of the challenges faced by businesses in their day-to-day operations.</p>
